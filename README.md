#Slim Boilerplate using Gulp, Twig, Eloquent and Phinx

I was playing with Slim, it's awesome and lightweight however as it is a micro framework it doesn't come with things I use on most of my projects.

The idea of this **not** to tie a project project down to any particular architecture or technology you may want to use, but provide a boilerplate which can easily be adjusted to suit your requirements.

I have implemented [Laravel's Eloquent](http://laravel.com/docs/5.0/eloquent) ORM for working with the database and [Phinx](http://docs.phinx.org/en/latest/index.html) for database migrations.

I have used [Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/) for the template engine and [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) to handle the assets.
