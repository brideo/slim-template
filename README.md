#Slim Boilerplate using Gulp and Twig

I was playing with Slim, it's awesome and lightweight however as it is a micro framework it doesn't come with things I use on most of my projects.

The idea of this **not** to tie a project project down to any particular architecture or technology you may want to use, but provide a boilerplate which can easily be adjusted to suit your requirements.

    composer install
